INTRODUCTION

The goal of sslcaudit project is to develop a utility to automate testing SSL/TLS
clients for resistance against MITM attacks. It might be useful for testing a thick
client, a mobile application, an appliance, pretty much anything communicating over
SSL/TLS over TCP.

INSTALLATION

There is no proper installation procedure yet (Debian package and distutils-based
Python installer are coming soon). For now just fetch the release from GIT repository:

	$ git clone -b release_1_0 https://github.com/grwl/sslcaudit.git
	Cloning into sslcaudit...

Then find sslcaudit in the top level directory and run it with -h option. PDF
user-guide is available at doc/sslcaudit-user-guide-1.0.pdf.

Sslcaudit uses M2Crypto Python library. On Debian system M2Crypto library can be
installed with the following command:

	$ sudo apt-get install python-m2crypto
